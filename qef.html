						As an intern at Intuit, I designed <a href="http://quickemployerforms.com">Quick Employer Forms</a> as a web application that simplifies the task of filing small employer tax forms. Quick Employer Forms was designed for small business owners who do not have their own payroll departments to help them save time preparing, filing, and mailing W-2 and 1099-MISC forms. As the sole designer, I worked with a cross-functional team of product managers, user researchers, writers, tax professionals, and developers to quickly design, test, and ship the application. It was shipped one month after the end of my internship and eventually rolled into the TurboTax application.

						I mapped out and user flows and sketched concepts, which were immediately placed in front of customers for usability studies. After planning the studies with the user researcher, observing the sessions and conducting a few on my own, I used our findings to iterate on the most promising concepts. We also worked together to construct personas to embody most of our use cases and tested the paper wireframes on coworkers who were unfamiliar with the product. I created eight sets of digital wireframes, each improving on the last, and completed the interaction design by the end of the internship.
