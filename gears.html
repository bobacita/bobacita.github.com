						For our tangible user interfaces class, two classmates and I created Music to My Gears, a set of musical gears that record and play back sounds at varying speeds and in various combinations. We explored the affordances of the gears to create a fun, hands-on musical experience.
   					</p>
					<p class="longtext">
						We started out with a brainstorming session and produced conceptual sketches. Over the course of a few months, we built working prototypes, playing back different drum sounds and eventually adding the ability to record unique sounds. Our setup involved a web cam under a clear table, gears marked with unique patterns (phicons) for the software to identify, and Processing, Arduino, and Max code.

						We conducted 11 in-depth interviews to understand subjects' relationships with food and cooking, and distributed an online survey, coding and analyzing the responses. Our findings suggested that while people find cooking to be too timing consuming and stressful because it's difficult to time multiple dishes, cooking can be immensely rewarding because of the creative, experimental process of transforming raw ingredients into a tangible and tasty creation.<br><br>
                                    Creating storyboards helped us explore different ideas, and conducting a competitive analysis gave us an idea of what had already been done in the field. We tested our idea for Cookmark as an experience prototype (using paper) and iteratively created interactive prototypes, starting from paper and progressing into a full-fledged proof-of-concept prototype coded in PHP and Flex. Along the way we tested our prototypes on 10 users, who produced delicious meals, and asked them to fill out a survey discussing their experience with the prototype.
